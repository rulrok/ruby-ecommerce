ABOUT THE ASSETS DIR

From http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html

Assets can still be placed in the public hierarchy. Any assets under public will be served as static files by the
application or web server when config.serve_static_files is set to true. You should use app/assets for files that
must undergo some pre-processing before they are served.

In production, Rails precompiles these files to public/assets by default. The precompiled copies are then served
as static assets by the web server. The files in app/assets are never served directly in production.
